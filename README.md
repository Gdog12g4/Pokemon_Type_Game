# **Pokemon Types Game (Python)** by Gerald Fleming

## A Beginner Level Python project to outline the flow of a project as well as use of modules and functions. 
#
## Pokemon battle simulator based on real up-to-date strength and weakness charts. We use the Random() module as well as multiple custom functions to make difficult tasks easier by breaking them into individual parts.

## Ways to Improve
- I could have used python class to tighten the code work for defining the strengths and weaknesses for more concise code.
- I can apply the core of the code to a web app and add more visual aspects to it so it's not just playable from the console.
